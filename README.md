# AnomalyWatch-AI: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Supply Chain Operations

AnomalyWatch-AI is an **AI-driven anomaly detection system** that identifies **abnormal patterns in supply chain operations** using **unsupervised machine learning**. The platform detects **rare but high-impact events**—such as shipment delays, cost spikes, and demand anomalies—enabling **early risk detection** and improved operational resilience.

Designed for continuous monitoring, AnomalyWatch-AI integrates seamlessly with data pipelines and analytics platforms to surface actionable signals before disruptions escalate.

## Overview
AnomalyWatch-AI continuously analyzes operational supply chain data to uncover deviations from normal behavior without requiring labeled examples. By learning baseline patterns across shipments, costs, and demand, the system flags emerging anomalies that may signal disruption, inefficiency, or risk.

The platform supports both batch and near–real-time analysis, enabling organizations to detect issues early and respond proactively.
